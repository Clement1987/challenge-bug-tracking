# Know how to track bugs in a program and fix them

As a developer, you will spend a lot of time finding bugs and fixing them.
This challenge lets you practice your skills in that area, though the issues there are quite
simple, and you have unit tests ! Easy, right ?

I can guarantee you that most bugs are not that easy : you have a lot more code to analyze, and the case in which the bug occurs is not always clear.
Some bugs are really nasty, and they disappear when you try to attach a debugger or try to reproduce them.

Good luck !

## The C# challenge
This challenge uses NUnit to test the code in the .cs files.

You need to have dotnet installed. You can use Visual Studio but this is not mandatory, Visual Studio Code should be enough (or even notepad or vi ðŸ˜‚ ).

You can run tests with `dotnet test`

You will need to fix the .cs files under `ChallengeBugTracking`. You may not commit any change to the files in the `ChallengeBugTracking.Tests` folder (but you can edit the file temporarily if you want to try things out).
