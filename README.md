# Know how to track bugs in a program and fix them

As a developer, you will spend a lot of time finding bugs and fixing them.
This challenge lets you practice your skills in that area, though the issues there are quite
simple, and you have unit tests ! Easy, right ?

I can guarantee you that most bugs are not that easy : you have a lot more code to analyze, and the case in which the bug occurs is not always clear.
Some bugs are really nasty, and they disappear when you try to attach a debugger or try to reproduce them.

Good luck !

## The javascript challenge

This challenges uses [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) to test the code in the .js files.

You need to have node.js installed.

The first time, you will need to install the package with `npm install`

You can run tests with `npm test`

You need to fix the .js files in the root folders.
You may not commit any change the files in the spec/ folder (but you can edit the files if you want to try things out)
